# Development Containers

<!--- cSpell:ignore Wouter Peetermans --->

Crash course docker and development containers.

---

## Problem statement

---

I work on many projects. Each of them have their own tool requirements. Some even use the same tool, but a different version.

---

I have to figure out which tools I need. Download and install them. And use the right version for the right project. This is hard! ‚òπÔ∏è

---

* I don't want to figure out which tools I need. The project should provide a list.
* I don't want to install the tools system wide to avoid conflicts with other versions for other projects.

---

## Solution

---

Create a virtual machine for each project?

(virtualbox, vmware, ...)

---

Several gigabytes in size, so not possible to add to version control (for example git repository).

---

* I don't want to figure out which tools I need. The project should provide a list. ‚õîÔ∏è
* I don't want to install the tools system wide to avoid conflicts with other versions for other projects. ‚úÖ

---

Can we do better?

---

Note:

* <https://www.docker.com/>

---

Build virtual machines from a text file with the required tools.

---

<!--- cSpell:disable --->
```dockerfile
# Pick operating system for virtual machine
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:ubuntu-24.04

# Install required tools
RUN apt-get update && export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive \
    && apt-get -y install software-properties-common \
                          build-essential cmake valgrind \
                          clang lldb llvm gdb
```

### Dockerfile

---

Dockerfile can be added to version control!

---

* I don't want to figure out which tools I need. The project should provide a list. ‚úÖ
* I don't want to install the tools system wide to avoid conflicts with other versions for other projects. ‚úÖ

---

But I'm still not happy...

---

* I don't want to manually build and run the docker container.
* I don't want to manually set up my IDE for remote development.

---

### Development Containers

Note:

* <https://containers.dev/>

* Picture borrowed from <https://xebia.com>

---

Add devcontainer.json file in .devcontainer directory to project. IDE will pick this up automatically, build the devcontainer and connect to it.

---

<!--- cSpell:disable --->
```json
{
    "name": "My fancy C++ container",
    "build": {
        "dockerfile": "Dockerfile"
    },
    "customizations": {
        "vscode": {
            "extensions": [
                "ms-vscode.cpptools-extension-pack"
            ]
        }
    },
    "remoteUser": "vscode"
}
```
<!--- cSpell:enable --->

#### devcontainer.json

Note:

* Text file, so can be added to version control
* Can use Dockerfile or an existing image name
* Can configure IDE settings
* Can provide list of IDE extensions

---

* I don't want to manually build and run the docker container. ‚úÖ
* I don't want to manually set up my IDE for remote development. ‚úÖ

---

Now I'm happy! üòÅ

## Crash course development containers

---

### Starting a project in a devcontainer

---

#### Step 1: Open the project directory in your IDE

(vscode, clion)

Note:

* The project directory is the directory that contains the .devcontainer directory

---

#### Step 2: vscode will ask to install the Dev Containers extension, accept

(unless the extension is already installed)

  <source src="./assets/vscode_open_devcontainer.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <img src="./assets/vscode_open_devcontainer.png" alt="vscode open in devcontainer">
</video>

#### Step 3: vscode will ask to reopen the project in a devcontainer, accept

Note:

* This will take a while, the docker container has to be created and started

### devcontainer.json

## Crash course docker

---

### Installing docker on windows

<https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/>

---

Using development containers will leave a bunch of docker containers on your system that can take up quite a bit of disk space.

---

```bash
# show the list of docker images
docker images
```

```bash
# show the list of all running and stopped containers
docker ps -a
```

```bash
# remove all images that are not in use by running containers
# remove all stopped containers
docker system prune -af
```
