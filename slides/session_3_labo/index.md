## Devcontainer
<https://gitlab.apstudent.be/cpp-programming/devcontainer-labo-3>
---
* Similar to labo 2 devcontainer.
* Uses a src subdirectory.
* Has a cpprog module with expect function.
* See [README.md](https://gitlab.apstudent.be/cpp-programming/devcontainer-labo-3/-/blob/main/README.md) file in git repository.
---
```c++
import cpprog;

int my_division(int numerator, int denominator)
{
    cpprog::expect([&]{ return denominator != 0; },
                   "cannot divide by zero");

    return numerator / denominator;
}
```

Note:
* How to use the except function for preconditions?
* See also hellocontracts example in devcontainer.

## Clang-tidy
### bugprone-exception-escape
---
Finds functions which may throw an exception directly or indirectly, but they should not. The functions which should not throw exceptions are the following:

Note:
* <https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/exception-escape.html>
---
* Destructors
* Move constructors
* Move assignment operators
* The main() functions <!-- .element: class="fragment highlight-current-blue" -->
* swap() functions
* iter_swap() functions
* iter_move() functions
* Functions marked with throw() or noexcept
* Other functions given as option

Note:
* When an exception escapes the main function, the application crashes.
* Don't worry about the other functions yet. ðŸ˜‰
---
### Solution
Catch exceptions in the main function!
---
```c++ []
using std;

int main()
try
{
    // ...
    return 0;
}
catch (std::exception const& e)
{
    std::cerr << e.what() << '\n';
    return 1;
}
```

Note:
* Print error message to the console error stream (STDERR).
* Return 0 for success.
* Return 1 for failure.
* This is a convention.

## Debugger demo

Note:
* breakpoints
* step, resume
* variable watch
* call stack (will be covered in a later session)
